# web-player-discord-bot
A project developed as a web-player panel for a Discord Bot.

This project makes a connection with the exclusive api of a Discord music bot, the exposed project will not work because of this exclusive api of the bot. But have an idea of how it was accomplished, remembering that I am a beginner in this area

# Demo
- Enter the panel's website <a href="" target="_blanck">here</a>.
- Click the "+" button to add the bot to your server.

- Use the commands:</br>

```
b!play <name_music|link_music>  [To tell the bot to play a certain song]
```
```
b!token  [To receive your panel access TOKEN]
```

- Go back to the web-player panel and insert the returned token.
- Click on the icon beside to validate and login your token.
- Ready! You can now manage your music through a web-player panel.
